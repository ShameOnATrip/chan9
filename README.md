>/g/ projects

Essentially some guys from /g/ are going to modify Plan9 and add lightweight C utilities (I think?) to make it a more user friendly and accessible (again, I think).

We'll see how it turns out.

Notes/Suggestions:
Let's not advertise this on /g/ at all until we have a release date and a decent amount of work done.  Too many chefs spoil the soup and the bread and the main course and fucking everything.  Once a dev base is created, keep the masses out.  I don't want some asshat forking what you guys (the devs) have already done and tricking other people into diverting effort and attention from the original.
